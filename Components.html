        <h1>Components in React.js</h1>
        <hr />
        <h2>Introduction to Components</h2>
        <h3>What are Components in React.js?</h3>
        <p>
            Components are the building blocks of React.js applications. They are reusable and independent pieces of code
            that encapsulate
            specific functionalities or UI elements.
        </p>
        <p>
            In React, components can be classified into two main types: functional components and class components.
            Functional components are
            simple JavaScript functions that take props (properties) as input and return JSX (JavaScript XML) to describe
            the UI. Class
            components are JavaScript classes that extend React.Component and have their own state and lifecycle methods.
        </p>
        <p>
            Components enable developers to break down the user interface into smaller, manageable parts, making code
            organization, debugging,
            and maintenance easier. They also promote reusability, as components can be reused across different parts of the
            application or
            even in different projects.
        </p>
        <br />
    
        <h3>Creating and Using Components</h3>
        <p>
            In React.js, creating and using components is straightforward. Functional components can be defined as arrow
            functions or regular
            functions that return JSX. Class components are defined as JavaScript classes that extend React.Component and
            implement a render
            method to return JSX.
        </p>
        <p>
            Once defined, components can be used within other components or in the main application JSX by simply invoking
            them as if they were
            HTML tags.
        </p>
        <p>
            Here's an example of a simple functional component named <code>Button</code>:
        </p>
        <pre class="codeBlock">
            <code class="language-js">
                import React from 'react';
    
                const Button = ({ text }) => {
                    return (
                        &lt;button&gt;{text}&lt;/button&gt;
                    );
                };
    
                export default Button;
            </code>
        </pre>
        <p>
            This component takes a prop named <code>text</code> and renders a button with the provided text.
        </p>
        <br />
    
        <h3>Component Composition</h3>
        <p>
            Component composition is a powerful concept in React.js that allows developers to combine multiple components to
            create complex UI
            structures. Components can be nested within each other, allowing for a hierarchical organization of the user
            interface.
        </p>
        <p>
            By breaking down the UI into smaller, reusable components and composing them together, developers can build
            scalable and
            maintainable applications with ease.
        </p>
        <br />
    
        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        <p>
            Components are the heart of React.js development, enabling developers to build dynamic and interactive user
            interfaces. By
            understanding the principles of component-based architecture and mastering the creation and composition of
            components, developers
            can create powerful and flexible applications that meet the needs of users and stakeholders.
