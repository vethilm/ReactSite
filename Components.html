      <h2>Introduction to Components</h2>
      <h3>What are Components in React.js?</h3>
      <p>
        Components are the building blocks of React.js applications. They are
        reusable and independent pieces of code that encapsulate specific
        functionalities or UI elements.
      </p>
      <p>
        In React, components can be classified into two main types: functional
        components and class components. Functional components are simple
        JavaScript functions that take props (properties) as input and return
        JSX (JavaScript XML) to describe the UI. Class components are JavaScript
        classes that extend React.Component and have their own state and
        lifecycle methods.
      </p>
      <p>
        Components enable developers to break down the user interface into
        smaller, manageable parts, making code organization, debugging, and
        maintenance easier. They also promote reusability, as components can be
        reused across different parts of the application or even in different
        projects.
      </p>
      <br />

      <h3>Creating and Using Components</h3>
      <p>
        In React.js, creating and using components is straightforward.
        Functional components can be defined as arrow functions or regular
        functions that return JSX. Class components are defined as JavaScript
        classes that extend React.Component and implement a render method to
        return JSX.
      </p>
      <p>
        Once defined, components can be used within other components or in the
        main application JSX by simply invoking them as if they were HTML tags.
      </p>
      <p>
        Here's an example of a simple functional component named
        <code>Button</code>:
      </p>
      <pre class="codeBlock">
            <code class="language-js">
                import React from 'react';
    
                const Button = ({ text }) => {
                    return (
                        &lt;button&gt;{text}&lt;/button&gt;
                    );
                };
    
                export default Button;
            </code>
        </pre>
      <p>
        This component takes a prop named <code>text</code> and renders a button
        with the provided text.
      </p>
      <br />

      <h3>Component Composition</h3>
      <p>
        Component composition is a powerful concept in React.js that allows
        developers to combine multiple components to create complex UI
        structures. Components can be nested within each other, allowing for a
        hierarchical organization of the user interface.
      </p>
      <p>
        By breaking down the UI into smaller, reusable components and composing
        them together, developers can build scalable and maintainable
        applications with ease.
      </p>
      <br />

      <h3>Conclusion</h3>
      <p>
        Components are the heart of React.js development, enabling developers to
        build dynamic and interactive user interfaces. By understanding the
        principles of component-based architecture and mastering the creation
        and composition of components, developers can create powerful and
        flexible applications that meet the needs of users and stakeholders.
