## Key Points
- Introduction to React and its importance in the MERN stack.
    - 
- Setting up a React project (create-react-app).

    - it will propmt to install neccessary packages - enter `y` and it will install them and create the app, this might take a few minutes
    - run `cd [app-name]` to navigate to the app's directory
    - run `npm start` to open your web app on a local server
    - the page is populated with defualt files that will can edit to create your app
    - if you want to create an empty app, without all the files create-react-app installs, you can create your folder and populate the files yourself
        - [[ file organization and neccessary files ]]
        -  w node + npm installed, run `npm start`
- Dependencies
    - packages that are used in the react project
    - listed in the packages-lock.json file
    - [[ how to intall and use ]]
    - [[ example ]]
- Components, props, and state management.
- Hooks and lifecycle methods.
- Routing with React Router.
- State management with Context API or Redux.
